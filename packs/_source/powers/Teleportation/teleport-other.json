If the check is successful, the character can teleport the target as far away as their Teleport power normally allows them in combat. If the target winds up in something solid, they are automatically pushed out of it but take damage from the disruption equal to a standard action check. The damage multiplier is 1 for every space they must move to reach a clear area. If this kills them, their body is trapped inside the material they teleported into.",
