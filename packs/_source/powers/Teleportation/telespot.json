As a reaction, they can deploy a small teleportal against a physical attack, deflecting it away or redirecting it to another target. They can harmlessly deflect any such attack automatically that isn't a Fantastic success. Redirecting an attack to another target requires the character to make an Agility check against the new target's Agility defense. On a success, use the original attack's damage against the new target. On a Fantastic success, double the damage. On a failure, the original attack hits the character instead."
