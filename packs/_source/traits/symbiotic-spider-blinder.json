This effect is passed on to the symbiote's offspring as well. The reason is that Spider-Sense detects the previously bonded symbiote as part of itself and thus not a threat.  Vigilance checks to perceive danger from such a symbiote.  Nor do such symbiotes have trouble on Agility checks against the character's Vigilance defense."
