Being berserk gives the character an edge on all close attacks and adds +2 to their Melee, Resilience and Ego defenses. However, it takes –2 from their Agility defense, and they cannot use ranged weapons. If the character defeats the enemy who hurt them, they must then charge to attack the next closest foe. At the end of the character's turn, they lose 5 Focus. When their Focus is reduced to the point that the character could not voluntarily spend any more Focus—or if there are no enemies in sight—the berserk state automatically ends."
