    "description": "The character has a wealthy benefactor they can ask to purchase them anything within reason. The patron could be an individual, an organization or even a government. The character's access to the resources the patron provides depends on their relationship with the patron. If they anger or embarrass their patron, they might be cut off and have to remove this tag. This is similar to the Rich tag, but the character is relying on someone else's wealth. One example of this happened recently when Peter Parker worked for a repentant Norman Osborn. Parker had access to Osborn's resources while he continued to work with him.",
